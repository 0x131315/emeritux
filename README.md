# emeritux.sh

A neat Bash script to build and install Enlightenment 23 on **Linux Mint Tessa**.  

## **Get started**

Make sure that the `build-essential` and `git` packages are installed, then open Terminal and clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/emeritux.git
```

That creates a new folder named  _"emeritux"_  in your home directory.

Please copy the file  _"emeritux.sh"_  from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x emeritux.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./emeritux.sh
```

On subsequent runs, open Terminal and simply type:

```bash
emeritux.sh
```

(Use tab completion: Just type  _eme_  and press Tab)

### **Update local repository**

Be sure to check for updates at least once a week.

In order to do this, change to ~/emeritux/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```

That's it.

Mind the cows! :cow2: :cow2:  :cow2:
